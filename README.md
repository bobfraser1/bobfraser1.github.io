## Bob Fraser

I am a technical product manager with a portfolio of work for marquis companies in a variety of product areas. I love working with bright, creative people building great solutions.

I am currently at [Hewlett Packard Enterprise](https://hpe.com/info/composable/) on the Composable Data Center Infrastructure team, basically managing bare metal resources just like the cloud.
